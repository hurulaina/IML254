                <p>'C' means comic here and the 'M3' stands for the three popular comics which are Manhwa, Manhua and Manga. What's the difference or what are they you ask? Well for starters, Manhwas are comic adaptaions of korean novels. Similarly, Manhuas are comic adaptations of chinese novels and mangas are adaptations of japanese novels.</p>

                <p>I love reading and the first real book i read when growing up is a thick novel book, with no illustrations at all, and it is a Harry Potter Book.<br> After the that the other books i read are printed books first before i found online books and comics. </p>

                <p>As you know, time evolves technology and that goes for books too. Most of the e-books i read however are the manhwas' original novel stories and a few fanfictions on wattpad or browser sites, but i do have a few saved pdf novels that i have managed to get my hands on and are waiting for me to read them.</p>
